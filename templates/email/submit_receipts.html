    <p>Dear {{ grant.contact_first_name }} {{ grant.contact_last_name }},</p>
    <p>This is a reminder to submit receipts for your grant <i>{{ grant.project }}</i>. You can submit receipts and review the items for
        which you were granted funds on your <a href="{{ url_for('grant', grant_id=grant.grant_id, _external=True)}}">grant status page</a>.</p>
    <p>Your receipts are due by the end of exam period, which is <b>May 13 at 11:59 pm</b>. Failure to submit receipts by that time
        could make you ineligible for future grants.</p>
    <p>Best,
    <br>Nicholas Boucher
    <br><i>Treasurer, Undergraduate Council</i></p>
